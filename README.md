# Project: Event Management Platform with Microservices

**Description:** Develop an event management platform where users can create, manage, and participate in events. The platform should support search, recommendations, and real-time notifications functionalities.

**Study/Practice Topics:**

- **Spring Boot** for each microservice
- **Spring Cloud** for microservices integration and management (Eureka, Config Server, Gateway)
- **Spring Data JPA** and **Spring Data MongoDB** for data persistence
- **Spring Security** with OAuth2 and JWT for authentication and authorization
- **Docker** and **Kubernetes** for containerization and orchestration
- **Apache Kafka** or **RabbitMQ** for asynchronous communication and event processing
- **REST APIs** and **GraphQL** for communication between services and frontend
- **React** or **Angular** for frontend (demanded in the USA)
- **Redis** for caching and session management
- **Elasticsearch** for advanced search functionalities
- **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for monitoring and metrics
- **CI/CD** with Jenkins or GitHub Actions
- **Testing**: Unit, Integration, and Performance with JUnit, Mockito, and Testcontainers
- **Hexagonal Architecture** (for flexibility and maintainability)

**Key Features:**

**Event Management:**

- Create, edit, and delete events.
- View event details and participate.

**Search and Recommendations:**

- Advanced event search with Elasticsearch.
- Personalized recommendations based on interests and participation history.

**Real-Time Notifications:**

- Send real-time notifications to participants (WebSockets, Kafka).

**Authentication and Authorization:**

- User login and registration using OAuth2 and JWT.
- Different access levels (users, organizers, administrators).

**Admin Dashboard:**

- Dashboard for administrators to manage events, users, and view metrics.

**Project Benefits:**

- **Microservices Understanding:** Deep knowledge of designing and implementing distributed systems.
- **Cloud Native Skills:** Experience with Spring Cloud, Docker, and Kubernetes, essential for modern architectures.
- **Full-Stack Development:** Integration of a robust backend with a modern frontend (React/Angular).
- **Search and Data Analysis:** Implementation of advanced search and recommendation features with Elasticsearch and Machine Learning.
- **Monitoring and DevOps:** Practices of monitoring and CI/CD pipelines highly valued in the USA.

**Project Structure:**

**Backend Services:**

- **User Service:** User management, authentication, and authorization.
- **Event Service:** Event management.
- **Notification Service:** Notification sending.
- **Recommendation Service:** Event recommendations.

**Frontend:**

- SPA application with React or Angular.

**Infrastructure:**

- Docker Compose for local development.
- Kubernetes for production deployment.
- ELK Stack for logging and monitoring.
- Prometheus and Grafana for metrics.

**Technologies and Tools:**

- **Backend:** Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Spring Data, Kafka/RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch.
- **Frontend:** React or Angular, Redux/NgRx.
- **DevOps:** Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins/GitHub Actions, Prometheus, Grafana.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis.
- **Testing:** JUnit, Mockito, Testcontainers.
